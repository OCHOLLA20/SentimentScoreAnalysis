Project Description

Project Title: SentimentScoreAnalysis

Overview: Aim of this project is to realize a tool of sentiment analysis fully developed, which allows to compare the performance of three of the top-of-the-line models (BERTS, RoBERTa, DistilBERT). The tool is intended to conducted customer review analysis, compute sentiment scores, and detect discrepancies between the model prediction and the review rating score. Through visualization and comparison among these results, we seek to know which model is most effective for different kinds of sentiment analysis tasks.

Objectives: Objectives:

Data Collection: Collect a data set of customer reviews, including textual reviews, ratings, and additional related metadata.

Sentiment Analysis: Use BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models to perform sentiment analysis for each review.

Comparison: Compare the sentiment scores from each model with the actual review ratings to identify discrepancies.

Visualization: Construct visualizations to display the sentiment scores and their variations, which can help in a straightforward comparison.

Analysis: Explore specific cases in which sentiment scores and review rating are systematically different to shed light on the performance and shortcomings of the models.

Methods: Methods:

Data Preparation: Data Preparation:

To extract customer reviews with corresponding fields like Id, rating, title, review, etc.

Create a pandas DataFrame to store the dataset.

Sentiment Analysis Models: Sentiment Analysis Models:

Use the transformers library from Hugging face to load and using BERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT models.

Define functions to compute sentiment scores for each model.

Combine calculated sentiment scores with the original DataFrame for comparison.

Discrepancy Analysis: Discrepancy Analysis:

Calculate the differences between sentiment scores and review ratings.

Pick and emphasize the reviews where the sentiment scores and ratings vary most.

Visualization: Visualization:

Pair plots and bar plots of sentiment scores generated by various models are visualized using seaborn and matplotlib.

Emphasize the largest discrepancies between model scores and observed ratings.

Tools and Libraries: Tools and Libraries:

Python: The programming language implemented for data processing and analysis.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

seaborn and matplotlib: For data visualization.

transformers: For implementing BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models.

scipy: For scientific computing and using the softmax function.

Implementation Steps: Implementation Steps:

Initialize the Environment: Initialize the Environment:

Develop a new system and install required packages with conda or pip.

Data Collection and Preparation: Data Collection and Preparation:

Load the dataset and create the DataFrame.

Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment Analysis:

Use BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models to get the sentiment scores.

Merge the sentiment scores with the original DataFrame.

Comparison and Visualization: Comparison and Visualization:

Pair plots and bar charts are used to visualize and compare the sentiment scores.

Identify and display the most significant discrepancies.
